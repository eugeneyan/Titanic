      "take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\n",

      "falling down a very deep well.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she\n",
      "had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to\n",
      "wonder what was going to happen next.  First, she tried to look\n",
      "down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to\n",
      "see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and\n",
      "noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves;\n",
      "here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs.  She\n",
      "took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was\n",
      "labelled `ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it\n",
      "was empty:  she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing\n",
      "somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she\n",
      "fell past it.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Well!' thought Alice to herself, `after such a fall as this, I\n",
      "shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs!  How brave they'll\n",
      "all think me at home!  Why, I wouldn't say anything about it,\n",
      "even if I fell off the top of the house!' (Which was very likely\n",
      "true.)\n",
      "\n",
      "  Down, down, down.  Would the fall NEVER come to an end!  `I\n",
      "wonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud.\n",
      "`I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth.  Let\n",
      "me see:  that would be four thousand miles down, I think--' (for,\n",
      "you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her\n",
      "lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a VERY good\n",
      "opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to\n",
      "listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) `--yes,\n",
      "that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude\n",
      "or Longitude I've got to?'  (Alice had no idea what Latitude was,\n",
      "or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to\n",
      "say.)\n",
      "\n",
      "  Presently she began again.  `I wonder if I shall fall right\n",
      "THROUGH the earth!  How funny it'll seem to come out among the\n",
      "people that walk with their heads downward!  The Antipathies, I\n",
      "think--' (she was rather glad there WAS no one listening, this\n",
      "time, as it didn't sound at all the right word) `--but I shall\n",
      "have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know.\n",
      "Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and she tried\n",
      "to curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you're falling\n",
      "through the air!  Do you think you could manage it?)  `And what\n",
      "an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking!  No, it'll\n",
      "never do to ask:  perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  Down, down, down.  There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon\n",
      "began talking again.  `Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I\n",
      "should think!'  (Dinah was the cat.)  `I hope they'll remember\n",
      "her saucer of milk at tea-time.  Dinah my dear!  I wish you were\n",
      "down here with me!  There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but\n",
      "you might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know.\n",
      "But do cats eat bats, I wonder?'  And here Alice began to get\n",
      "rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of\n",
      "way, `Do cats eat bats?  Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, `Do\n",
      "bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either\n",
      "question, it didn't much matter which way she put it.  She felt\n",
      "that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she\n",
      "was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very\n",
      "earnestly, `Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:  did you ever eat a\n",
      "bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of\n",
      "sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a\n",
      "moment:  she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her\n",
      "was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in\n",
      "sight, hurrying down it.  There was not a moment to be lost:\n",
      "away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it\n",
      "say, as it turned a corner, `Oh my ears and whiskers, how late\n",
      "it's getting!'  She was close behind it when she turned the\n",
      "corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen:  she found\n",
      "herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps\n",
      "hanging from the roof.\n",
      "\n",
      "  There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked;\n",
      "and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the\n",
      "other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle,\n",
      "wondering how she was ever to get out again.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of\n",
      "solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key,\n",
      "and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the\n",
      "doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or\n",
      "the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of\n",
      "them.  However, on the second time round, she came upon a low\n",
      "curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little\n",
      "door about fifteen inches high:  she tried the little golden key\n",
      "in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small\n",
      "passage, not much larger than a rat-hole:  she knelt down and\n",
      "looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.\n",
      "How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about\n",
      "among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but\n",
      "she could not even get her head through the doorway; `and even if\n",
      "my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, `it would be of\n",
      "very little use without my shoulders.  Oh, how I wish\n",
      "I could shut up like a telescope!  I think I could, if I only\n",
      "know how to begin.'  For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things\n",
      "had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few\n",
      "things indeed were really impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "  There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she\n",
      "went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on\n",
      "it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like\n",
      "telescopes:  this time she found a little bottle on it, (`which\n",
      "certainly was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the neck\n",
      "of the bottle was a paper label, with the words `DRINK ME'\n",
      "beautifully printed on it in large letters.\n",
      "\n",
      "  It was all very well to say `Drink me,' but the wise little\n",
      "Alice was not going to do THAT in a hurry.  `No, I'll look\n",
      "first,' she said, `and see whether it's marked \"poison\" or not';\n",
      "for she had read several nice little histories about children who\n",
      "had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant\n",
      "things, all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules\n",
      "their friends had taught them:  such as, that a red-hot poker\n",
      "will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your\n",
      "finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had\n",
      "never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked\n",
      "`poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or\n",
      "later.\n",
      "\n",
      "  However, this bottle was NOT marked `poison,' so Alice ventured\n",
      "to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort\n",
      "of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast\n",
      "turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished\n",
      "it off.\n",
      "\n",
      "     *       *       *       *       *       *       *\n",

      "\n",
      "  `What a curious feeling!' said Alice; `I must be shutting up\n",
      "like a telescope.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  And so it was indeed:  she was now only ten inches high, and\n",
      "her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right\n",
      "size for going through the little door into that lovely garden.\n",
      "First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was\n",
      "going to shrink any further:  she felt a little nervous about\n",
      "this; `for it might end, you know,' said Alice to herself, `in my\n",
      "going out altogether, like a candle.  I wonder what I should be\n",
      "like then?'  And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is\n",
      "like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember\n",
      "ever having seen such a thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "  After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided\n",
      "on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice!\n",
      "when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the\n",
      "little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it,\n",
      "she found she could not possibly reach it:  she could see it\n",
      "quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb\n",
      "up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;\n",
      "and when she had tired herself out with trying,\n",
      "the poor little thing sat down and cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to\n",
      "herself, rather sharply; `I advise you to leave off this minute!'\n",
      "She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very\n",
      "seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so\n",
      "severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered\n",
      "trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game\n",
      "of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious\n",
      "child was very fond of pretending to be two people.  `But it's no\n",

      "a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in\n",
      "the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and\n",
      "behind them a railway station.)  However, she soon made out that\n",

      "trying.'  So she began:  `O Mouse, do you know the way out of\n",
      "this pool?  I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!'\n",
      "(Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse:\n",

      "seen in her brother's Latin Grammar, `A mouse--of a mouse--to a\n",
      "mouse--a mouse--O mouse!')  The Mouse looked at her rather\n",
      "inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little\n",

      "her French lesson-book.  The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the\n",
      "water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright.  `Oh, I beg\n",
      "your pardon!' cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the\n",
      "poor animal's feelings.  `I quite forgot you didn't like cats.'\n",

      "nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face--and\n",
      "she is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she's such a capital\n",
      "one for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice again,\n",

      "more if you'd rather not.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `We indeed!' cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end\n",
      "of his tail.  `As if I would talk on such a subject!  Our family\n",
      "always HATED cats:  nasty, low, vulgar things!  Don't let me hear\n",
      "the name again!'\n",
      "\n",

      "subject of conversation.  `Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?'\n",

      "such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you!\n",
      "A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly\n",
      "brown hair!  And it'll fetch things when you throw them, and\n",
      "it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things--I\n",
      "can't remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer, you\n",
      "know, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds!\n",
      "He says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!' cried Alice in a\n",
      "sorrowful tone, `I'm afraid I've offended it again!'  For the\n",
      "Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and\n",
      "making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.\n",
      "\n",
      "  So she called softly after it, `Mouse dear!  Do come back\n",
      "again, and we won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't\n",
      "like them!'  When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam\n",
      "slowly back to her:  its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice\n",
      "thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, `Let us get to\n",
      "the shore, and then I'll tell you my history, and you'll\n",
      "understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.'\n",

      "for your walk!\" \"Coming in a minute, nurse!  But I've got to see\n",

      "  By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with\n",
      "a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two\n",
      "or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves:  she took up the fan and\n",
      "a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when\n",
      "her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-\n",
      "glass.  There was no label this time with the words `DRINK ME,'\n",

      "SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,' she said to herself,\n",
      "`whenever I eat or drink anything; so I'll just see what this\n",
      "bottle does.  I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for\n",

      "\n",
      "  It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected:\n",
      "before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing\n",
      "against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being\n",
      "broken.  She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself\n",
      "`That's quite enough--I hope I shan't grow any more--As it is, I\n",

      "\n",
      "  Alas! it was too late to wish that!  She went on growing, and\n",
      "growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor:  in\n",
      "another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried\n",
      "the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the\n",
      "other arm curled round her head.  Still she went on growing, and,\n",
      "as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one\n",
      "foot up the chimney, and said to herself `Now I can do no more,\n",

      "out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `It was much pleasanter at home,' thought poor Alice, `when one\n",
      "wasn't always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about\n",
      "by mice and rabbits.  I almost wish I hadn't gone down that\n",
      "rabbit-hole--and yet--and yet--it's rather curious, you know,\n",
      "this sort of life!  I do wonder what CAN have happened to me!\n",
      "When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing\n",
      "never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one!  There\n",
      "ought to be a book written about me, that there ought!  And when\n",

      "I'm here!  Digging for apples, yer honour!'\n",
      "\n",

      "honour, at all, at all!'  `Do as I tell you, you coward!' and at\n",
      "last she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in\n",
      "the air.  This time there were TWO little shrieks, and more\n",
      "sounds of broken glass.  `What a number of cucumber-frames there\n",
      "must be!' thought Alice.  `I wonder what they'll do next!  As for\n",

      "better now--but I'm a deal too flustered to tell you--all I know\n",
      "is, something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes\n",
      "like a sky-rocket!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `So you did, old fellow!' said the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `We must burn the house down!' said the Rabbit's voice; and\n",
      "Alice called out as loud as she could, `If you do.  I'll set\n",
      "Dinah at you!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to\n",
      "herself, `I wonder what they WILL do next!  If they had any\n",
      "sense, they'd take the roof off.'  After a minute or two, they\n",
      "began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, `A\n",
      "barrowful will do, to begin with.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `A barrowful of WHAT?' thought Alice; but she had not long to\n",
      "doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came\n",
      "rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face.\n",
      "`I'll put a stop to this,' she said to herself, and shouted out,\n",
      "`You'd better not do that again!' which produced another dead\n",
      "silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all\n",
      "turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright\n",
      "idea came into her head.  `If I eat one of these cakes,' she\n",
      "thought, `it's sure to make SOME change in my size; and as it\n",
      "can't possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I\n",
      "suppose.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find\n",
      "that she began shrinking directly.  As soon as she was small\n",
      "enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and\n",
      "found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside.\n",
      "The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by\n",
      "two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle.\n",
      "They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but she\n",
      "ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a\n",
      "thick wood.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `The first thing I've got to do,' said Alice to herself, as she\n",
      "wandered about in the wood, `is to grow to my right size again;\n",
      "and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden.\n",
      "I think that will be the best plan.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and\n",
      "simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the\n",
      "smallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering\n",
      "about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over\n",
      "her head made her look up in a great hurry.\n",
      "\n",
      "  An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round\n",
      "eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her.\n",
      "`Poor little thing!' said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried\n",
      "hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the\n",
      "time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it\n",
      "would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of\n",
      "stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped\n",
      "into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight,\n",
      "and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice\n",
      "dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run\n",
      "over; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy\n",
      "made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in\n",
      "its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very\n",
      "like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every\n",
      "moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle\n",
      "again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the\n",
      "stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long\n",
      "way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat\n",
      "down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its\n",
      "mouth, and its great eyes half shut.\n",
      "\n",
      "  This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape;\n",
      "so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out\n",
      "of breath, and till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the\n",
      "distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `And yet what a dear little puppy it was!' said Alice, as she\n",
      "leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself\n",
      "with one of the leaves:  `I should have liked teaching it tricks\n",
      "very much, if--if I'd only been the right size to do it!  Oh\n",
      "dear!  I'd nearly forgotten that I've got to grow up again!  Let\n",
      "me see--how IS it to be managed?  I suppose I ought to eat or\n",
      "drink something or other; but the great question is, what?'\n",
      "\n",
      "  The great question certainly was, what?  Alice looked all round\n",
      "her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see\n",
      "anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under\n",
      "the circumstances.  There was a large mushroom growing near her,\n",
      "about the same height as herself; and when she had looked under\n",
      "it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her\n",
      "that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "  She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of\n",
      "the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large\n",
      "caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded,\n",
      "quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice\n",
      "of her or of anything else.\n",

      "\n",
      "  `Who are YOU?' said the Caterpillar.\n",

      "\n",
      "  `I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly,' Alice replied very\n",
      "politely, `for I can't understand it myself to begin with; and\n",
      "being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `It isn't,' said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet,' said Alice; `but\n",
      "when you have to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day, you\n",

      "\n",
      "  `You!' said the Caterpillar contemptuously.  `Who are YOU?'\n",
      "\n",
      "  Which brought them back again to the beginning of the\n",
      "conversation.  Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's\n",
      "making such VERY short remarks, and she drew herself up and said,\n",
      "very gravely, `I think, you ought to tell me who YOU are, first.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Why?' said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not\n",
      "think of any good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in\n",
      "a VERY unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Come back!' the Caterpillar called after her.  `I've something\n",
      "important to say!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  This sounded promising, certainly:  Alice turned and came back\n",
      "again.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Keep your temper,' said the Caterpillar.\n",

      "she could.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `No,' said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else\n",
      "to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth\n",
      "hearing.  For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but\n",
      "at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth\n",
      "again, and said, `So you think you're changed, do you?'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I'm afraid I am, sir,' said Alice; `I can't remember things as\n",

      "\n",
      "  `Repeat, \"YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,\"' said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice folded her hands, and began:--\n",
      "\n",
      "    `You are old, Father William,' the young man said,\n",
      "      `And your hair has become very white;\n",

      "      Do you think, at your age, it is right?'\n",
      "\n",
      "    `In my youth,' Father William replied to his son,\n",
      "      `I feared it might injure the brain;\n",
      "    But, now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,\n",
      "      Why, I do it again and again.'\n",
      "\n",
      "    `You are old,' said the youth, `as I mentioned before,\n",
      "      And have grown most uncommonly fat;\n",
      "    Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door--\n",
      "      Pray, what is the reason of that?'\n",
      "\n",
      "    `In my youth,' said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,\n",
      "      `I kept all my limbs very supple\n",
      "    By the use of this ointment--one shilling the box--\n",
      "      Allow me to sell you a couple?'\n",
      "\n",
      "    `You are old,' said the youth, `and your jaws are too weak\n",
      "      For anything tougher than suet;\n",
      "    Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak--\n",
      "      Pray how did you manage to do it?'\n",
      "\n",
      "    `In my youth,' said his father, `I took to the law,\n",

      "      Has lasted the rest of my life.'\n",
      "\n",
      "    `You are old,' said the youth, `one would hardly suppose\n",
      "      That your eye was as steady as ever;\n",
      "    Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose--\n",
      "      What made you so awfully clever?'\n",
      "\n",
      "    `I have answered three questions, and that is enough,'\n",
      "      Said his father; `don't give yourself airs!\n",

      "words have got altered.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `It is wrong from beginning to end,' said the Caterpillar\n",
      "decidedly, and there was silence for some minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The Caterpillar was the first to speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `What size do you want to be?' it asked.\n",
      "\n",

      "`only one doesn't like changing so often, you know.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice said nothing:  she had never been so much contradicted in\n",
      "her life before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Are you content now?' said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Well, I should like to be a LITTLE larger, sir, if you\n",
      "wouldn't mind,' said Alice:  `three inches is such a wretched\n",
      "height to be.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `It is a very good height indeed!' said the Caterpillar\n",
      "angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three\n",
      "inches high).\n",
      "\n",
      "  `But I'm not used to it!' pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone.\n",

      "easily offended!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `You'll get used to it in time,' said the Caterpillar; and it\n",
      "put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.\n",
      "\n",
      "  This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again.\n",
      "In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its\n",
      "mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself.  Then it got\n",
      "down off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely\n",
      "remarking as it went, `One side will make you grow taller, and\n",
      "the other side will make you grow shorter.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `One side of WHAT?  The other side of WHAT?' thought Alice to\n",
      "herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Of the mushroom,' said the Caterpillar, just as if she had\n",
      "asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a\n",
      "minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as\n",
      "it was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question.\n",
      "However, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they\n",
      "would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `And now which is which?' she said to herself, and nibbled a\n",
      "little of the right-hand bit to try the effect:  the next moment\n",
      "she felt a violent blow underneath her chin:  it had struck her\n",
      "foot!\n",
      "\n",
      "  She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but\n",
      "she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking\n",
      "rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit.\n",
      "Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was\n",
      "hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last, and\n",
      "managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "     *       *       *       *       *       *       *\n",

      "\n",
      "  `Come, my head's free at last!' said Alice in a tone of\n",
      "delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she\n",
      "found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found:  all she could\n",
      "see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which\n",
      "seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay\n",
      "far below her.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `What CAN all that green stuff be?' said Alice.  `And where\n",
      "HAVE my shoulders got to?  And oh, my poor hands, how is it I\n",
      "can't see you?'  She was moving them about as she spoke, but no\n",
      "result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the\n",
      "distant green leaves.\n",
      "\n",
      "  As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her\n",
      "head, she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted\n",
      "to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction,\n",
      "like a serpent.  She had just succeeded in curving it down into a\n",
      "graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which\n",
      "she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she\n",
      "had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a\n",
      "hurry:  a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating\n",
      "her violently with its wings.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Serpent!' screamed the Pigeon.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I'm NOT a serpent!' said Alice indignantly.  `Let me alone!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Serpent, I say again!' repeated the Pigeon, but in a more\n",
      "subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, `I've tried every\n",
      "way, and nothing seems to suit them!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I haven't the least idea what you're talking about,' said\n",
      "Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've\n",
      "tried hedges,' the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; `but\n",
      "those serpents!  There's no pleasing them!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no\n",
      "use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,' said the\n",
      "Pigeon; `but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and\n",
      "day!  Why, I haven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I'm very sorry you've been annoyed,' said Alice, who was\n",
      "beginning to see its meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood,' continued\n",
      "the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, `and just as I was\n",
      "thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come\n",
      "wriggling down from the sky!  Ugh, Serpent!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `But I'm NOT a serpent, I tell you!' said Alice.  `I'm a--I'm\n",
      "a--'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Well!  WHAT are you?' said the Pigeon.  `I can see you're\n",
      "trying to invent something!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I--I'm a little girl,' said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she\n",
      "remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `A likely story indeed!' said the Pigeon in a tone of the\n",
      "deepest contempt.  `I've seen a good many little girls in my\n",
      "time, but never ONE with such a neck as that!  No, no!  You're a\n",
      "serpent; and there's no use denying it.  I suppose you'll be\n",
      "telling me next that you never tasted an egg!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,' said Alice, who was a very\n",
      "truthful child; `but little girls eat eggs quite as much as\n",
      "serpents do, you know.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I don't believe it,' said the Pigeon; `but if they do, why\n",
      "then they're a kind of serpent, that's all I can say.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent\n",
      "for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of\n",
      "adding, `You're looking for eggs, I know THAT well enough; and\n",
      "what does it matter to me whether you're a little girl or a\n",

      "settled down again into its nest.  Alice crouched down among the\n",
      "trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled\n",
      "among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and\n",
      "untwist it.  After a while she remembered that she still held the\n",
      "pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very\n",
      "carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and\n",

      "there's half my plan done now!  How puzzling all these changes\n",
      "are!  I'm never sure what I'm going to be, from one minute to\n",
      "another!  However, I've got back to my right size:  the next\n",
      "thing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how IS that to be\n",
      "done, I wonder?'  As she said this, she came suddenly upon an\n",

      "upon them THIS size:  why, I should frighten them out of their\n",

      "that for two reasons.  First, because I'm on the same side of the\n",
      "door as you are; secondly, because they're making such a noise\n",
      "inside, no one could possibly hear you.'  And certainly there was\n",
      "a most extraordinary noise going on within--a constant howling\n",
      "and sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish\n",
      "or kettle had been broken to pieces.\n",

      "on without attending to her, `if we had the door between us.  For\n",
      "instance, if you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let\n",
      "you out, you know.'  He was looking up into the sky all the time\n",
      "he was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil.  `But\n",
      "perhaps he can't help it,' she said to herself; `his eyes are so\n",
      "VERY nearly at the top of his head.  But at any rate he might\n",
      "answer questions.--How am I to get in?' she repeated, aloud.\n",

      "  At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate\n",
      "came skimming out, straight at the Footman's head:  it just\n",
      "grazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one of the trees\n",
      "behind him.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `--or next day, maybe,' the Footman continued in the same tone,\n",
      "exactly as if nothing had happened.\n",

      "  `How am I to get in?' asked Alice again, in a louder tone.\n",

      "\n",
      "  `Oh, there's no use in talking to him,' said Alice desperately:\n",
      "`he's perfectly idiotic!'  And she opened the door and went in.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of\n",
      "smoke from one end to the other:  the Duchess was sitting on a\n",

      "sneezing and howling alternately without a moment's pause.  The\n",
      "only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook,\n",

      "ear to ear.\n",

      "  `Please would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, for\n",
      "she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to\n",
      "speak first, `why your cat grins like that?'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `It's a Cheshire cat,' said the Duchess, `and that's why.  Pig!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice\n",
      "quite jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed\n",
      "to the baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on\n",
      "again:--\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I\n",
      "didn't know that cats COULD grin.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `They all can,' said the Duchess; `and most of 'em do.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I don't know of any that do,' Alice said very politely,\n",

      "\n",
      "  Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought\n",
      "it would be as well to introduce some other subject of\n",
      "conversation.  While she was trying to fix on one, the cook took\n",
      "the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work\n",
      "throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby\n",
      "--the fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans,\n",
      "plates, and dishes.  The Duchess took no notice of them even when\n",
      "they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already, that it\n",
      "was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Oh, PLEASE mind what you're doing!' cried Alice, jumping up\n",
      "and down in an agony of terror.  `Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS\n",
      "nose'; as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very\n",
      "nearly carried it off.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `If everybody minded their own business,' the Duchess said in a\n",
      "hoarse growl, `the world would go round a deal faster than it\n",
      "does.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Which would NOT be an advantage,' said Alice, who felt very\n",
      "glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her\n",
      "knowledge.  `Just think of what work it would make with the day\n",
      "and night!  You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn\n",
      "round on its axis--'\n",

      "to take the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and\n",
      "seemed not to be listening, so she went on again:  `Twenty-four\n",
      "hours, I THINK; or is it twelve?  I--'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Oh, don't bother ME,' said the Duchess; `I never could abide\n",
      "figures!'  And with that she began nursing her child again,\n",
      "singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a\n",
      "violent shake at the end of every line:\n",
      "\n",
      "        `Speak roughly to your little boy,\n",

      "        `I speak severely to my boy,\n",

      "get ready to play croquet with the Queen,' and she hurried out of\n",
      "the room.  The cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out,\n",
      "but it just missed her.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-\n",
      "shaped little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all\n",
      "directions, `just like a star-fish,' thought Alice.  The poor\n",
      "little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it,\n",
      "and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again,\n",
      "so that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as much\n",
      "as she could do to hold it.\n",
      "\n",
      "  As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it,\n",
      "(which was to twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep\n",
      "tight hold of its right ear and left foot, so as to prevent its\n",
      "undoing itself,) she carried it out into the open air.  `IF I\n",
      "don't take this child away with me,' thought Alice, `they're sure\n",
      "to kill it in a day or two:  wouldn't it be murder to leave it\n",
      "behind?'  She said the last words out loud, and the little thing\n",
      "grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).  `Don't\n",
      "grunt,' said Alice; `that's not at all a proper way of expressing\n",
      "yourself.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into\n",
      "its face to see what was the matter with it.  There could be no\n",
      "doubt that it had a VERY turn-up nose, much more like a snout\n",
      "than a real nose; also its eyes were getting extremely small for\n",
      "a baby:  altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at\n",
      "all.  `But perhaps it was only sobbing,' she thought, and looked\n",
      "into its eyes again, to see if there were any tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "  No, there were no tears.  `If you're going to turn into a pig,\n",
      "my dear,' said Alice, seriously, `I'll have nothing more to do\n",
      "with you.  Mind now!'  The poor little thing sobbed again (or\n",
      "grunted, it was impossible to say which), and they went on for\n",
      "some while in silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice was just beginning to think to herself, `Now, what am I\n",
      "to do with this creature when I get it home?' when it grunted\n",
      "again, so violently, that she looked down into its face in some\n",
      "alarm.  This time there could be NO mistake about it:  it was\n",
      "neither more nor less than a pig, and she felt that it would be\n",
      "quite absurd for her to carry it further.\n",
      "\n",
      "  So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to\n",
      "see it trot away quietly into the wood.  `If it had grown up,'\n",
      "she said to herself, `it would have made a dreadfully ugly child:\n",
      "but it makes rather a handsome pig, I think.'  And she began\n",
      "thinking over other children she knew, who might do very well as\n",
      "pigs, and was just saying to herself, `if one only knew the right\n",
      "way to change them--' when she was a little startled by seeing\n",
      "the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice.  It looked good-\n",
      "natured, she thought:  still it had VERY long claws and a great\n",

      "\n",
      "  `Cheshire Puss,' she began, rather timidly, as she did not at\n",

      "\n",
      "  `Then it doesn't matter which way you go,' said the Cat.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `--so long as I get SOMEWHERE,' Alice added as an explanation.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Oh, you're sure to do that,' said the Cat, `if you only walk\n",
      "long enough.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another\n",
      "question.  `What sort of people live about here?'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `In THAT direction,' the Cat said, waving its right paw round,\n",
      "`lives a Hatter:  and in THAT direction,' waving the other paw,\n",
      "`lives a March Hare.  Visit either you like:  they're both mad.'\n",

      "\n",
      "  `I suppose so,' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Well, then,' the Cat went on, `you see, a dog growls when it's\n",
      "angry, and wags its tail when it's pleased.  Now I growl when I'm\n",
      "pleased, and wag my tail when I'm angry.  Therefore I'm mad.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I call it purring, not growling,' said Alice.\n",

      "with the Queen to-day?'\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "  `You'll see me there,' said the Cat, and vanished.\n",

      "\n",

      "did not appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the\n",
      "direction in which the March Hare was said to live.  `I've seen\n",
      "hatters before,' she said to herself; `the March Hare will be\n",
      "much the most interesting, and perhaps as this is May it won't be\n",
      "raving mad--at least not so mad as it was in March.'  As she said\n",
      "this, she looked up, and there was the Cat again, sitting on a\n",

      "\n",
      "  `Not the same thing a bit!' said the Hatter.  `You might just\n",

      "\n",
      "  `It IS the same thing with you,' said the Hatter, and here the\n",
      "conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute,\n",

      "writing-desks, which wasn't much.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The Hatter was the first to break the silence.  `What day of\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "  `It was the BEST butter,' the March Hare meekly replied.\n",
      "\n",

      "  The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily:  then\n",
      "he dipped it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again:  but he\n",

      "was the BEST butter, you know.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity.\n",
      "`What a funny watch!' she remarked.  `It tells the day of the\n",
      "month, and doesn't tell what o'clock it is!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Why should it?' muttered the Hatter.  `Does YOUR watch tell\n",
      "you what year it is?'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Of course not,' Alice replied very readily:  `but that's\n",
      "because it stays the same year for such a long time together.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Which is just the case with MINE,' said the Hatter.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice felt dreadfully puzzled.  The Hatter's remark seemed to\n",
      "have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English.\n",
      "`I don't quite understand you,' she said, as politely as she\n",
      "could.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `The Dormouse is asleep again,' said the Hatter, and he poured\n",
      "a little hot tea upon its nose.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without\n",
      "opening its eyes, `Of course, of course; just what I was going to\n",
      "remark myself.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Have you guessed the riddle yet?' the Hatter said, turning to\n",
      "Alice again.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `No, I give it up,' Alice replied:  `what's the answer?'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I haven't the slightest idea,' said the Hatter.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Nor I,' said the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice sighed wearily.  `I think you might do something better\n",
      "with the time,' she said, `than waste it in asking riddles that\n",
      "have no answers.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `If you knew Time as well as I do,' said the Hatter, `you\n",
      "wouldn't talk about wasting IT.  It's HIM.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I don't know what you mean,' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Of course you don't!' the Hatter said, tossing his head\n",
      "contemptuously.  `I dare say you never even spoke to Time!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Perhaps not,' Alice cautiously replied:  `but I know I have to\n",
      "beat time when I learn music.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Ah! that accounts for it,' said the Hatter.  `He won't stand\n",
      "beating.  Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do\n",
      "almost anything you liked with the clock.  For instance, suppose\n",
      "it were nine o'clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons:\n",
      "you'd only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the\n",
      "clock in a twinkling!  Half-past one, time for dinner!'\n",
      "\n",

      "whisper.)\n",
      "\n",
      "  `That would be grand, certainly,' said Alice thoughtfully:\n",
      "`but then--I shouldn't be hungry for it, you know.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Not at first, perhaps,' said the Hatter:  `but you could keep\n",
      "it to half-past one as long as you liked.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Is that the way YOU manage?' Alice asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The Hatter shook his head mournfully.  `Not I!' he replied.\n",
      "`We quarrelled last March--just before HE went mad, you know--'\n",
      "(pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) `--it was at the\n",
      "great concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing\n",

      "\n",
      "            \"Up above the world you fly,\n",
      "            Like a tea-tray in the sky.\n",

      "\n",
      "Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep\n",
      "`Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--' and went on so long that\n",
      "they had to pinch it to make it stop.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse,' said the Hatter,\n",
      "`when the Queen jumped up and bawled out, \"He's murdering the\n",
      "time!  Off with his head!\"'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `How dreadfully savage!' exclaimed Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `And ever since that,' the Hatter went on in a mournful tone,\n",
      "`he won't do a thing I ask!  It's always six o'clock now.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  A bright idea came into Alice's head.  `Is that the reason so\n",
      "many tea-things are put out here?' she asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Yes, that's it,' said the Hatter with a sigh:  `it's always\n",
      "tea-time, and we've no time to wash the things between whiles.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Then you keep moving round, I suppose?' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Exactly so,' said the Hatter:  `as the things get used up.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `But what happens when you come to the beginning again?' Alice\n",
      "ventured to ask.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Suppose we change the subject,' the March Hare interrupted,\n",
      "yawning.  `I'm getting tired of this.  I vote the young lady\n",
      "tells us a story.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I'm afraid I don't know one,' said Alice, rather alarmed at\n",
      "the proposal.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Then the Dormouse shall!' they both cried.  `Wake up,\n",
      "Dormouse!'  And they pinched it on both sides at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes.  `I wasn't asleep,' he\n",

      "\n",
      "  `What did they live on?' said Alice, who always took a great\n",
      "interest in questions of eating and drinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `They lived on treacle,' said the Dormouse, after thinking a\n",
      "minute or two.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `They couldn't have done that, you know,' Alice gently\n",
      "remarked; `they'd have been ill.'\n",

      "  `So they were,' said the Dormouse; `VERY ill.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways\n",
      "of living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went\n",
      "on:  `But why did they live at the bottom of a well?'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Take some more tea,' the March Hare said to Alice, very\n",
      "earnestly.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I've had nothing yet,' Alice replied in an offended tone, `so\n",
      "I can't take more.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `You mean you can't take LESS,' said the Hatter:  `it's very\n",

      "\n",
      "  `Nobody asked YOUR opinion,' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Who's making personal remarks now?' the Hatter asked\n",
      "triumphantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice did not quite know what to say to this:  so she helped\n",
      "herself to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the\n",
      "Dormouse, and repeated her question.  `Why did they live at the\n",
      "bottom of a well?'\n",
      "\n",
      "  The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and\n",
      "then said, `It was a treacle-well.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `There's no such thing!'  Alice was beginning very angrily, but\n",
      "the Hatter and the March Hare went `Sh! sh!' and the Dormouse\n",
      "sulkily remarked, `If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the\n",
      "story for yourself.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `No, please go on!' Alice said very humbly; `I won't interrupt\n",
      "again.  I dare say there may be ONE.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `One, indeed!' said the Dormouse indignantly.  However, he\n",
      "consented to go on.  `And so these three little sisters--they\n",
      "were learning to draw, you know--'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `What did they draw?' said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Treacle,' said the Dormouse, without considering at all this\n",
      "time.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I want a clean cup,' interrupted the Hatter:  `let's all move\n",
      "one place on.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him:  the\n",
      "March Hare moved into the Dormouse's place, and Alice rather\n",
      "unwillingly took the place of the March Hare.  The Hatter was the\n",
      "only one who got any advantage from the change:  and Alice was a\n",
      "good deal worse off than before, as the March Hare had just upset\n",
      "the milk-jug into his plate.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began\n",
      "very cautiously:  `But I don't understand.  Where did they draw\n",
      "the treacle from?'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `You can draw water out of a water-well,' said the Hatter; `so\n",
      "I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh,\n",
      "stupid?'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `But they were IN the well,' Alice said to the Dormouse, not\n",
      "choosing to notice this last remark.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Of course they were', said the Dormouse; `--well in.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse\n",
      "go on for some time without interrupting it.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `They were learning to draw,' the Dormouse went on, yawning and\n",
      "rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; `and they drew\n",
      "all manner of things--everything that begins with an M--'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Why with an M?' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "  Alice was silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going\n",
      "off into a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up\n",
      "again with a little shriek, and went on:  `--that begins with an\n",
      "M, such as mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--\n",
      "you know you say things are \"much of a muchness\"--did you ever\n",
      "see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?'\n",

      "\n",
      "  This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear:  she got\n",
      "up in great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep\n",
      "instantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of her\n",
      "going, though she looked back once or twice, half hoping that\n",
      "they would call after her:  the last time she saw them, they were\n",

      "\n",

      "and unlocking the door that led into the garden.  Then she went\n",
      "to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it\n",
      "in her pocket) till she was about a foot high:  then she walked down\n",

      "ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the\n",
      "soldiers did.  After these came the royal children; there were\n",
      "ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand\n",
      "in hand, in couples:  they were all ornamented with hearts.  Next\n",
      "came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice\n",
      "recognised the White Rabbit:  it was talking in a hurried nervous\n",
      "manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without\n",
      "noticing her.  Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the\n",
      "King's crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this\n",
      "grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on\n",
      "her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember\n",
      "ever having heard of such a rule at processions; `and besides,\n",
      "what would be the use of a procession,' thought she, `if people\n",
      "had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn't see it?'\n",
      "So she stood still where she was, and waited.\n",
      "\n",
      "  When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped\n",
      "and looked at her, and the Queen said severely `Who is this?'\n",
      "She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Idiot!' said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and,\n",
      "turning to Alice, she went on, `What's your name, child?'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,' said Alice very\n",
      "politely; but she added, to herself, `Why, they're only a pack of\n",
      "cards, after all.  I needn't be afraid of them!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `And who are THESE?' said the Queen, pointing to the three\n",
      "gardeners who were lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as\n",
      "they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs\n",
      "was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether\n",
      "they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her\n",
      "own children.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `How should I know?' said Alice, surprised at her own courage.\n",
      "`It's no business of MINE.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her\n",
      "for a moment like a wild beast, screamed `Off with her head!\n",
      "Off--'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Nonsense!' said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the\n",
      "Queen was silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said\n",
      "`Consider, my dear:  she is only a child!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave\n",
      "`Turn them over!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Get up!' said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the\n",
      "three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the\n",
      "King, the Queen, the royal children, and everybody else.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Leave off that!' screamed the Queen.  `You make me giddy.'\n",
      "And then, turning to the rose-tree, she went on, `What HAVE you\n",
      "been doing here?'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `May it please your Majesty,' said Two, in a very humble tone,\n",
      "going down on one knee as he spoke, `we were trying--'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I see!' said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the\n",
      "roses.  `Off with their heads!' and the procession moved on,\n",

      "gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `You shan't be beheaded!' said Alice, and she put them into a\n",
      "large flower-pot that stood near.  The three soldiers wandered\n",
      "about for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly\n",
      "marched off after the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Are their heads off?' shouted the Queen.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!' the soldiers\n",
      "shouted in reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `That's right!' shouted the Queen.  `Can you play croquet?'\n",
      "\n",
      "  The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question\n",
      "was evidently meant for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Yes!' shouted Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Come on, then!' roared the Queen, and Alice joined the\n",
      "procession, wondering very much what would happen next.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `It's--it's a very fine day!' said a timid voice at her side.\n",
      "She was walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously\n",
      "into her face.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Very,' said Alice:  `--where's the Duchess?'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Hush!  Hush!' said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone.  He\n",
      "looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised\n",
      "himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and\n",
      "whispered `She's under sentence of execution.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `What for?' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Did you say \"What a pity!\"?' the Rabbit asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `No, I didn't,' said Alice:  `I don't think it's at all a pity.\n",
      "I said \"What for?\"'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `She boxed the Queen's ears--' the Rabbit began.  Alice gave a\n",
      "little scream of laughter.  `Oh, hush!' the Rabbit whispered in a\n",
      "frightened tone.  `The Queen will hear you!  You see, she came\n",
      "rather late, and the Queen said--'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Get to your places!' shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder,\n",
      "and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up\n",
      "against each other; however, they got settled down in a minute or\n",
      "two, and the game began.  Alice thought she had never seen such a\n",
      "curious croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and\n",
      "furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live\n",
      "flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to\n",
      "stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her\n",
      "flamingo:  she succeeded in getting its body tucked away,\n",
      "comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down,\n",
      "but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened\n",
      "out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it\n",
      "WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a\n",
      "puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing:\n",
      "and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again,\n",
      "it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled\n",
      "itself, and was in the act of crawling away:  besides all this,\n",
      "there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she\n",
      "wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers\n",
      "were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the\n",
      "ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very\n",
      "difficult game indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The players all played at once without waiting for turns,\n",
      "quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in\n",
      "a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went\n",
      "stamping about, and shouting `Off with his head!' or `Off with\n",
      "her head!' about once in a minute.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice began to feel very uneasy:  to be sure, she had not as\n",
      "yet had any dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might\n",
      "happen any minute, `and then,' thought she, `what would become of\n",
      "me?  They're dreadfully fond of beheading people here; the great\n",
      "wonder is, that there's any one left alive!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering\n",
      "whether she could get away without being seen, when she noticed a\n",
      "curious appearance in the air:  it puzzled her very much at\n",
      "first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out to\n",
      "be a grin, and she said to herself `It's the Cheshire Cat:  now I\n",
      "shall have somebody to talk to.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `How are you getting on?' said the Cat, as soon as there was\n",
      "mouth enough for it to speak with.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded.  `It's no\n",
      "use speaking to it,' she thought, `till its ears have come, or at\n",
      "least one of them.'  In another minute the whole head appeared,\n",
      "and then Alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the\n",
      "game, feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her.  The\n",
      "Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight, and\n",
      "no more of it appeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I don't think they play at all fairly,' Alice began, in rather\n",
      "a complaining tone, `and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't\n",
      "hear oneself speak--and they don't seem to have any rules in\n",
      "particular; at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and\n",
      "you've no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive;\n",
      "for instance, there's the arch I've got to go through next\n",
      "walking about at the other end of the ground--and I should have\n",
      "croqueted the Queen's hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it\n",
      "saw mine coming!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `How do you like the Queen?' said the Cat in a low voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Not at all,' said Alice:  `she's so extremely--'  Just then\n",
      "she noticed that the Queen was close behind her, listening:  so\n",
      "she went on, `--likely to win, that it's hardly worth while\n",
      "finishing the game.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  The Queen smiled and passed on.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Who ARE you talking to?' said the King, going up to Alice, and\n",
      "looking at the Cat's head with great curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `It's a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,' said Alice:  `allow me\n",
      "to introduce it.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I don't like the look of it at all,' said the King:\n",
      "`however, it may kiss my hand if it likes.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I'd rather not,' the Cat remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Don't be impertinent,' said the King, `and don't look at me\n",
      "like that!'  He got behind Alice as he spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `A cat may look at a king,' said Alice.  `I've read that in\n",
      "some book, but I don't remember where.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Well, it must be removed,' said the King very decidedly, and\n",
      "he called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, `My dear!  I\n",
      "wish you would have this cat removed!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great\n",
      "or small.  `Off with his head!' she said, without even looking\n",
      "round.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I'll fetch the executioner myself,' said the King eagerly, and\n",
      "he hurried off.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game\n",
      "was going on, as she heard the Queen's voice in the distance,\n",
      "screaming with passion.  She had already heard her sentence three\n",
      "of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and\n",
      "she did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in\n",
      "such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or\n",
      "not.  So she went in search of her hedgehog.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog,\n",
      "which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one\n",
      "of them with the other:  the only difficulty was, that her\n",
      "flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where\n",
      "Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up\n",
      "into a tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "  By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back,\n",
      "the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight:\n",
      "`but it doesn't matter much,' thought Alice, `as all the arches\n",
      "are gone from this side of the ground.'  So she tucked it away\n",
      "under her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for\n",
      "a little more conversation with her friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "  When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to\n",
      "find quite a large crowd collected round it:  there was a dispute\n",
      "going on between the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who\n",
      "were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent,\n",
      "and looked very uncomfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to\n",
      "settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her,\n",
      "though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed\n",
      "to make out exactly what they said.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a\n",
      "head unless there was a body to cut it off from:  that he had\n",
      "never had to do such a thing before, and he wasn't going to begin\n",
      "at HIS time of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The King's argument was, that anything that had a head could be\n",
      "beheaded, and that you weren't to talk nonsense.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The Queen's argument was, that if something wasn't done about\n",
      "it in less than no time she'd have everybody executed, all round.\n",
      "(It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so\n",
      "grave and anxious.)\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice could think of nothing else to say but `It belongs to the\n",
      "Duchess:  you'd better ask HER about it.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `She's in prison,' the Queen said to the executioner:  `fetch\n",
      "her here.'  And the executioner went off like an arrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "   The Cat's head began fading away the moment he was gone, and,\n",
      "by the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely\n",

      "and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin.  However, she did not\n",

      "of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on\n",
      "the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently\n",

      "the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and\n",
      "still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place\n",
      "around her became alive the strange creatures of her little\n",

      "by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the\n",

      "the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,\n",
      "and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate\n",
      "guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the\n",
      "Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once\n",
      "more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's\n",
      "slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,\n",
      "filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable\n",
      "Mock Turtle.\n",
      "\n",
      "  So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in\n",
      "Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and\n",
      "all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only\n",
      "rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the\n",
      "reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-\n",
      "bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd\n",
      "boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and\n",
      "all the other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the\n",
      "confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the\n",

      "<h4>The Emacs text editor</h4>\r\n",
      "<p>Emacs is a customizable text editor which has some nice features specifically tailored for programmers. However, you can use any other text editor that you may prefer (such as <code>vi</code>, <code>pico</code>, or <code>joe</code> on Unix; or Notepad on Windows; or TextWrangler on OS X; and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_IDE#Python\">many more</a>).</p>\r\n",

      "</div>\r\n",
      "<p>Here we gave the argument <code>helloWorld.py</code> which will either open that file for editing if it exists, or create it otherwise. Emacs notices that this is a Python source file (because of the <code>.py</code> ending) and enters Python-mode, which is supposed to help you write code. When editing this file you may notice some of that text becomes automatically colored: this is syntax highlighting to help you distinguish items such as keywords, variables, strings, and comments. Pressing Enter, Tab, or Backspace may cause the cursor to jump to weird locations: this is because Python is very picky about indentation, and Emacs is predicting the proper tabbing that you should use.</p>\r\n",
      "<p>Some basic Emacs editing commands (<code>C-</code> means \"while holding the Ctrl-key\"):</p>\r\n",
      "<ul>\r\n",
      "<li><code>C-x C-s</code> Save the current file</li>\r\n",
      "<li><code>C-x C-f</code> Open a file, or create a new file it if doesn't exist</li>\r\n",
      "<li><code>C-k</code> Cut a line, add it to the clipboard</li>\r\n",
      "<li><code>C-y</code> Paste the contents of the clipboard</li>\r\n",
      "<li><code>C-_</code> Undo</li>\r\n",
      "<li><code>C-g</code> Abort a half-entered command</li>\r\n",
      "</ul>\r\n",
      "<p>You can also copy and paste using just the mouse. Using the left button, select a region of text to copy. Click the middle button to paste.</p>\r\n",
      "<p>There are two ways you can use Emacs to develop Python code. The most straightforward way is to use it just as a text editor: create and edit Python files in Emacs; then run Python to test the code somewhere else, like in a terminal window. Alternatively, you can run Python inside Emacs: see the options under \"Python\" in the menubar, or type <code>C-c !</code> to start a Python interpreter in a split screen. (Use <code>C-x o</code> to switch between the split screens, or just click if C-x doesn't work).</p>\r\n",
      "<p>If you want to spend some extra setup time becoming a power user, you can try an IDE like <a href=\"http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/\">Eclipse</a> (Download the Eclipse Classic package at the bottom).
